"Corpus linguistics and data-driven learning in EAP: A critical review","Smith, J.; Brown, K.",2019,"English for Specific Purposes","This paper reviews the application of corpus linguistics and data-driven learning (DDL) approaches in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) contexts. Drawing on 50 empirical studies published between 2010-2018, we examine how corpus-based methods have been implemented in academic writing instruction. Key findings indicate that DDL approaches improve students' awareness of academic conventions, particularly in lexical choices and grammatical patterns. However, challenges remain in teacher training and integration with existing curricula. We argue for a balanced approach that combines corpus consultation with traditional pedagogical methods."
"The BAWE corpus: A window into university student writing","Thompson, P.; Davies, R.",2018,"Journal of English for Academic Purposes","The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus represents a major resource for understanding disciplinary writing practices across UK universities. Comprising 2,761 assignments from 35 disciplines, the corpus enables systematic analysis of genre variation and linguistic features. This article describes the corpus design, compilation procedures, and potential applications for writing instruction and assessment. We present case studies demonstrating how BAWE can inform teaching materials and highlight disciplinary differences in rhetorical structure, metadiscourse, and citation practices."
"Exploring lexical bundles in undergraduate student writing: A corpus-driven approach","Martinez, L.; Chen, W.",2020,"Applied Linguistics","","Using machine learning for automated essay scoring: Insights from corpus analysis","Johnson, M.; Lee, S.; Park, H.",2021,"Computers & Education","This study investigates the application of machine learning algorithms for automated essay scoring (AES) of L2 academic writing. We trained models on 1,500 essays from the BAWE corpus, annotated with holistic scores and analytic rubric ratings. Results show that random forest and neural network models achieve correlation coefficients above 0.75 with human raters when trained on linguistic features derived from corpus analysis. The study discusses implications for assessment practices and identifies areas where human judgment remains crucial, particularly for evaluating argument quality and originality."
"Genre awareness through corpus consultation: An intervention study","Anderson, K.",2019,"System","This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of corpus-based genre awareness training on graduate students' (N=42) academic writing development. The intervention group received explicit instruction in using corpus tools to explore linguistic patterns in published research articles, while the control group followed traditional genre instruction. Pre- and post-tests of research article writing showed that the corpus consultation group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in appropriate use of hedging devices, citation integration, and move structures. Qualitative interviews revealed increased metalinguistic awareness and confidence in disciplinary writing conventions."
"Data-driven learning in EAP classrooms: Teacher perspectives and practices","Williams, T.; Baker, C.",2020,"TESOL Quarterly","Through surveys (N=156) and interviews (N=22) with EAP instructors across UK and Australian universities, this study explores teacher attitudes toward and implementation of data-driven learning (DDL) approaches. Findings reveal enthusiasm for corpus-based methods but significant barriers to adoption, including limited training, time constraints, and uncertainty about integrating DDL with existing curricula. Teachers who successfully implement DDL emphasize guided discovery, appropriate scaffolding, and combining corpus work with traditional instruction. The study offers practical recommendations for professional development and institutional support."
"Phraseological patterns in engineering students' reports: A corpus-based analysis","Chang, Y.; Watson, D.",2018,"","This research analyzes phraseological patterns in 250 engineering student reports from the BAWE corpus, comparing them with published engineering articles. Using n-gram analysis and manual functional categorization, we identify commonly used lexical bundles and their discourse functions. Results show that student writing relies heavily on procedural bundles but underuses stance and engagement bundles common in expert writing. The findings inform development of discipline-specific materials for engineering writing courses and highlight the value of comparative corpus analysis for understanding student versus expert writing."
"Automated feedback on academic vocabulary: Effects on L2 writing quality","Robinson, S.; Kim, M.",2021,"Language Learning & Technology","This experimental study (N=84 ESL students) tested the effectiveness of an automated feedback tool that provides corpus-based suggestions for academic vocabulary use. Students in the treatment group used the tool over one semester when revising essays, while the control group received only teacher feedback. Analysis of final drafts using corpus-derived metrics showed the automated feedback group demonstrated significantly greater use of academic word list items and discipline-appropriate vocabulary. Surveys indicated high user satisfaction but also highlighted the need for pedagogical training on interpreting corpus-based feedback effectively."
"Exploring metadiscourse in student dissertations across disciplines","","2019","English for Specific Purposes","This corpus study examines the use of metadiscourse markers in 120 undergraduate dissertations spanning six disciplines (Business, Biology, History, Engineering, Linguistics, and Law) from the BAWE corpus. Using Hyland's metadiscourse framework, we identified and compared interactive and interactional metadiscourse across disciplines. Findings reveal significant disciplinary variation: soft disciplines (History, Linguistics) show higher frequencies of interactional markers (hedges, boosters, attitude markers), while hard disciplines (Biology, Engineering) rely more on interactive markers (transitions, code glosses). The study demonstrates the value of corpus-based approaches for understanding disciplinary writing conventions and informing genre-specific instruction."
"Corpus consultation and writing fluency development: A longitudinal case study","Taylor, F.",2020,"Journal of Second Language Writing","This longitudinal case study tracked four international graduate students' writing development over one academic year as they learned to use corpus tools for independent writing support. Through writing samples, screen recordings of corpus consultation sessions, and reflective journals, the study examined how corpus use influenced writing fluency, accuracy, and lexical sophistication. Results indicate that students initially struggled with query formulation but gradually developed more efficient search strategies. Writing analysis showed improvements in lexical diversity and phraseological appropriateness, though fluency gains were modest. The study highlights the importance of explicit training in corpus literacy for effective DDL implementation."
"Investigating citation practices in student writing: A multidimensional corpus analysis","Green, A.; White, P.; Harris, J.",2018,"Written Communication","Drawing on 500 essays from the BAWE corpus, this study conducts a multidimensional analysis of citation practices in undergraduate student writing. We examined citation density, integration strategies (integral vs. non-integral), and rhetorical functions across three broad disciplinary groupings (Arts & Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences). Findings reveal significant disciplinary differences: Arts & Humanities essays show highest citation density with preference for integral citations and interpretive functions, while Sciences demonstrate lower density with predominantly non-integral citations for establishing research context. The study provides empirical evidence for discipline-specific citation instruction and demonstrates the value of large-scale corpus analysis for understanding writing practices."
"Using concordancers in academic writing classes: Student perceptions and learning outcomes","Murphy, R.; O'Brien, T.",2021,"ReCALL","","Analyzing rhetorical moves in literature reviews: Implications for teaching","Davies, M.",2019,"English for Specific Purposes","This study examines rhetorical move structures in 80 literature review sections from BAWE corpus dissertations across four disciplines (Applied Linguistics, Business Studies, Psychology, and Sociology). Using Swales' CARS model and disciplinary move analysis, we identified common and discipline-specific move patterns. Results show while certain moves (e.g., establishing territory, creating niche) appear across disciplines, their realization and sequencing vary significantly. Applied Linguistics and Sociology reviews demonstrate more explicit gap identification, while Business and Psychology emphasize practical applications. These findings inform development of discipline-sensitive teaching materials for literature review writing."
"Learner corpus research and writing assessment: Developing valid measures","Peterson, K.; Zhang, L.",2020,"Assessing Writing","This methodological study explores how learner corpus analysis can inform development of valid writing assessment measures for academic contexts. Using the BAWE corpus as a benchmark, we identified linguistic features that distinguish proficiency levels and disciplinary writing competence. Through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we developed and validated a rubric incorporating corpus-derived criteria including lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and genre appropriateness. Application to 200 new essays demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability (α = 0.89) and criterion validity. The study demonstrates the potential of corpus linguistics to enhance assessment validity and reliability in academic writing contexts."
"Disciplinary vocabulary in student essays: A frequency-based analysis","Foster, L.",2018,"Journal of English for Academic Purposes","This corpus study analyzes the use of disciplinary-specific vocabulary in 300 undergraduate essays from three disciplines (History, Biology, Economics) drawn from the BAWE corpus. Using frequency lists and keyword analysis, we identified discipline-specific lexical profiles and compared student vocabulary use with published academic articles in corresponding fields. Results reveal that student essays show appropriate use of core disciplinary vocabulary but underuse specialized technical terms and mid-frequency academic words. The study argues for explicit vocabulary instruction that bridges general academic English and discipline-specific terminology, supported by corpus-based materials."
"Automated writing evaluation tools: Corpus linguistics perspectives","Collins, J.; Scott, E.",2021","System","","Exploring stance-taking in argumentative essays: A corpus-pragmatic approach","Hughes, D.; Mitchell, S.",2019,"Discourse Studies","This corpus-pragmatic study investigates stance-taking strategies in 150 argumentative essays from the BAWE corpus, examining how student writers position themselves in relation to knowledge claims and reader expectations. Drawing on appraisal theory and metadiscourse analysis, we identified patterns of epistemic stance (hedges, boosters, evidentials) and attitudinal stance (attitude markers, engagement markers). Findings show disciplinary variation in stance density and preferred realization strategies. Arts & Humanities essays demonstrate more explicit stance-taking and reader engagement, while Sciences show more cautious hedging around empirical claims. The study contributes to understanding disciplinary discourse practices and informs teaching of appropriate academic voice."
"The role of formulaic sequences in academic writing development","Morris, C.",2020,"Applied Linguistics","This study examines the acquisition and use of formulaic sequences in L2 academic writing development. Analyzing writing samples from 60 international students over two years alongside expert writing from published journals, we tracked changes in formulaic sequence use, diversity, and appropriacy. Results indicate that advanced students gradually shift from overreliance on high-frequency formulaic sequences to more varied and contextually appropriate expressions. However, discipline-specific formulaic sequences remain challenging even for advanced writers. The study argues for explicit instruction in formulaic language combined with corpus consultation opportunities to support writing development."
"Comparative genre analysis using learner and expert corpora","Allen, B.; Turner, M.",2018,"Journal of Second Language Writing","","Investigating grammatical complexity in student academic writing","Palmer, N.",2021,"Language Learning","This longitudinal study examines the development of grammatical complexity in L2 academic writing over one academic year. Analyzing 240 essays from 60 ESL students enrolled in pre-sessional and in-sessional EAP courses, we measured syntactic complexity using 14 indices including T-unit length, clause complexity, and phrase complexity. Results show significant growth in clause subordination and phrasal complexity, with stronger gains for students who engaged in corpus-based writing activities. Comparison with BAWE corpus norms indicates that even advanced L2 writers produce less complex structures than L1 undergraduate writers, suggesting the need for extended support beyond entry-level EAP courses."
"Corpus-informed materials development for EAP: A design-based research approach","Richards, P.; Cooper, H.",2019,"System","This design-based research study documents the iterative development, implementation, and evaluation of corpus-informed teaching materials for an undergraduate EAP course. Over three cycles of design and refinement, we created materials targeting academic vocabulary, disciplinary collocations, and genre-specific language patterns derived from corpus analysis. Classroom implementation with 90 students showed improvements in targeted linguistic features and positive student engagement. Teacher interviews highlighted the importance of appropriate scaffolding and integration with curriculum goals. The study offers a model for systematic corpus-informed materials development and emphasizes the need for pedagogical mediation between corpus data and classroom practice."
